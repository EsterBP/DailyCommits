        <h2>Early Human Counting Systems</h2>
        <h3>Tally Marks and Primitive Counting</h3>
        <p>Around 30,000 BC, early humans used tally marks on bones to count and track resources.
        The Ishango Bone, discovered in Central Africa, is one of the earliest known counting artifacts.</p>

        <h2>Ancient Numerical Systems</h2>
        <h3>Mesopotamia and the Base-60 System</h3>
        <p>Around 3,000 BC, the Sumerians of Mesopotamia developed the first sophisticated numerical system.
        They created the base-60 system, which we still use for measuring time and angles today.</p>
        <h3>Egyptian Numerals</h3>
        <p>Ancient Egyptians also developed a system of symbols for numbers, often used in trade and construction.
        Their system relied on a base-10 structure but was less efficient for complex calculations.</p>

        <h2>Greek and Roman Contributions</h2>
        <h3>Greek Number Theory and Mathematics</h3>
        <p>Greek mathematicians like Pythagoras and Euclid explored number theory, geometry, and the nature of numbers.
        Their work laid the foundation for much of Western mathematical thought.</p>
        <h3>Roman Numerals</h3>
        <p>The Roman numeral system used letters to represent numbers but lacked a zero.
        Roman numerals are still seen today in specific contexts like clocks and book chapters.</p>

        <h2>The Hindu-Arabic Numeral Revolution</h2>
        <h3>The Invention of the Hindu-Arabic Numeral System</h3>
        <p>Originating in India around the 6th century AD, this system introduced the concept of zero and place value.</p>
        It allowed for much more efficient arithmetic and complex calculations.
        <h3>Spread to the Islamic World and Europe</h3>
        <p>The Hindu-Arabic system spread to the Islamic world through scholars like Al-Khwarizmi.
        By the 13th century, it had reached Europe and revolutionized commerce and science.</p>

        <h2>Modern Developments in Numbers</h2>
        <h3>The Role of Numbers in Science and Technology</h3>
        <p>Numbers have become indispensable in the development of modern science, engineering, and computer technology.
        From the development of algorithms to encryption, numbers are at the core of today's digital world.</p>
